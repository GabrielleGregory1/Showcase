        <h1>Hugo Story</h1>
        <p class="major">Creating a website to showcase the artork of CU Students, Alumni and Professors.</a>.
</p>
        <p>The digital design program and the broader College of Arts and Media currently lack a centralized, cohesive digital presence to showcase the exceptional work of their students and alumni. This limits the program's ability to gain public visibility, attract prospective students, and connect students and alumni with industry professionals. According to UCraft, creating a place to showcase your work helps boost your online presence. Furthermore, having your work online points to the value of community in the university and can inspire other creatives. Despite the wealth of talent within the program, this lack of public visibility means missed opportunities to promote student work, foster alumni connections, and enhance the col-lege’s reputation in a competitive arts and design landscape. Students, alumni, and faculty need a centralized, professional digital showcase for their work because it is critical for gaining public visibility, connecting with industry professionals, and attracting prospective students to the program.

        <h2>Design Rationale</h2>
        <p>Through sketches of wireframes, device rationale, competitive analysis and research, design I designed multi-screen, multi-device site. I emphasized and prioritized the screens that are where the students, alumni and professors can showcase their artwork and profile. I figured this should be priority in showcasing the site because that is what makes the site different. I want there to be different ways to go about the artwork from different classes, to hashtags, along with an area for Thesis work to be showcased. I wanted the site to be mostly visual with every opportunity to show artwork on a screen possible without being too cluttered.</p>
